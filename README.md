## Description
At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment—perhaps as part of an interview process. This coding quiz app is designed to help you practice coding quiz questions with a timer and high score storage. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## User Story
As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- When I click the start button, a timer starts, and I am presented with a question.
- When I answer a question, I am presented with another question.
- When I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.
- When the game is over, I can save my initials and my score.
